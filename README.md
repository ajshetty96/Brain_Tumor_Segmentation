# Brain Tumor Segmentation

This project is a *deep learning–based brain tumor segmentation application* that uses a *U-Net* model to detect and segment tumor regions from MRI brain scans.
It provides an *interactive web interface* built with *Streamlit*, allowing users to upload MRI images and visualize the predicted tumor mask instantly.

## Tech Stack
- *Python 3.10*

- *TensorFlow / Keras* – for loading and running the trained U-Net model

- *NumPy* – for numerical and array operations

- *Pillow (PIL)* – for image processing

- *Streamlit* – for building the interactive web application interface
